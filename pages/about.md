I'm Jason, and its been a very unconventional journey to where I am now.

Professionally, I wear plenty of hats between project management, systems administration and server and client side development.  I love Python, with Java and ES6+ JavaScript as a dead heat for second.  I spend alot of work time with Django and React, and participate at local meetups as a presenter on various engineering and development talks. Check out my [CV](/cv), and you can find me on [Pyslackers Slack](https://pyslackers.com/slack/), usually in the django, webdev and javascript channels.

Off the computer, I like to spend time cooking in the kitchen, on the trails with my bike, and most of all, with my fiancee and dog.
